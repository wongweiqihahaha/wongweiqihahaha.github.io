My Topic

</h1>

#### My topic is to investigate the <i>synergy between Spotify songs and YouTube videos through data visualization</i>, uncovering how music performance on both platforms interplays and influences audience engagement and trends. I will be identifying the top trends and characteristics with popular youtube videos and spotify tracks.

<h1 style="text-align:center;">

Data Sources

</h1>

#### The following datasets from Kaggle to explore my topics were used:

##### 1. Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023 : <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023>

##### 2. Spotify and Youtube: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube/data>

### Week 9 Diary:

##### For week 9, I have planned out the rough layout of my app using some sketches I did on my tablet, however these will be executed in the later weeks when I hopefully firm up my webpage. Here are the following content:

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", out.height="20%",fig.cap="Images I sketched to visualise my website",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("~/Documents/GitHub/NM2207/Week-10/Pic_1.jpg","~/Documents/GitHub/NM2207/Week-10/Pic_4.jpg","~/Documents/GitHub/NM2207/Week-10/Pic_3.jpg","~/Documents/GitHub/NM2207/Week-10/Pic_2.jpg"))

Week 10 Diary:

</h1>

### (1) My Question: What is the synergy between the various elements in a song?

### (2) Why do I find this question important to answer?

-   As the evolution of music grows, we can learn how the relationships and dynamics of different elements in a song affects how people perceive music to be addictive. Songs with musical groove have become popular as naturalistic stimuli to study interactions between auditory and motor brain regions (O'Connell et al, 2022)
-   It is important to understand what makes music popular and what are the specific elements of creating a popular song that is enjoyed by many.
-   Different audiences may have different preferences different musical elements, which can be useful in understanding these preferences which can help artists tailor their music to specific groups based on their songs.

### (3) Which rows and columns of the dataset will be used to answer this question?

#### From Spotify & Youtube Dataset

-   Columns:
    -   Musical Attributes: Danceability, Energy, Key, Loudness, Speechiness, Acousticness, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Valence, Tempo
    -   Duration_ms
    -   Views
    -   Likes
    -   Comments
    -   Artist
    -   Track
    -   Stream
-   Rows: All rows

#### From Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023 Dataset

-   Columns:
    -   track_name: Name of the song
    -   artist_count: Number of artists contributing to the song
    -   in_spotify_playlists: Number of Spotify playlists the song is included in
    -   in_spotify_charts: Presence and rank of the song on Spotify charts
    -   streams: Total number of streams on Spotify
    -   bpm: Beats per minute, a measure of song tempo
    -   key: Key of the song
    -   mode: Mode of the song (major or minor)
    -   danceability\_%: Percentage indicating how suitable the song is for dancing
    -   valence\_%: Positivity of the song's musical content
    -   energy\_%: Perceived energy level of the song
    -   acousticness\_%: Amount of acoustic sound in the song
    -   instrumentalness\_%: Amount of instrumental content in the song
    -   liveness\_%: Presence of live performance elements
    -   speechiness\_%: Amount of spoken words in the song

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### (4) Why did I choose this dataset:

-   I have chosen two datasets to answer the questions on the synergy in songs and their performance on YouTube and Spotify separately
-   There are a few reasons as to why I chose this datasets
    -   Global YouTube Statistics 2023 / Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023
        -   Both datasets have numerical variables that contains data types such as doubles, integers, complex numbers, logical variables which can be manipulated
        -   Both datasets also have categorical variables that contains nominal variables, string values. This will allow me to understand the qualitative aspects of the dataset as well.

### (5) Basic Visualisations to draw:

#### I will be looking at the following graphs to come up with some possible visualisations, although I will not be creating all of them.

-   **Correlation Heatmap**: I will use a heatmap to visualize correlations between musical attributes and popularity metrics.

-   **Scatter Plots**: I will plot scatter plots with regression lines to showcase the relationship between two variables.
    One graph that I can visualise is to plot "Danceability" on the x-axis and "Spotify Streams" on the y-axis to see if more danceable songs get more streams.

-   **Bar Chart** : I will create bar charts to compare the number of streams/views/likes for official vs. non-official videos.
    Also, for categorical variables like "key," you can visualize the number of songs in each key.

-   **Histogram**: I will create histograms to visualize the distribution of continuous variables, such as song tempo or loudness.
    It'll help to understand the most common tempo or loudness values among the top songs.

-   **Word Cloud**: Based on the "Description" of YouTube videos, I will attempt to create a word cloud to see which words or phrases are most commonly mentioned.

### (6) Advanced Graphs:

#### I hope to enhance my skills to make better and more informed graphs through R.

-   **Bivariate Relationship**: I would like to identify those variables that have relationships with each other and to identify whether they can impact each other.
    I hope to create a pair plot to visualize the bivariate relationships between each pair of variables.

-   **Violin Plot for Stream Distributions**: Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of Spotify Streams across different keys or any other categorical variable, providing more depth than a standard box plot.

### Process of cleaning of Data: Excel

This week, I will start by cleaning my data.
Here is a snapshot of my variables from "Spotify & Youtube" dataset.

```{r,eval= TRUE, echo=FALSE}


dtf <- read_csv("spotify_youtube.csv")
dtf

```

Here is a snapshot of my variables from "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023" dataset.

```{r,eval= TRUE, echo=FALSE}


dtf <- read_csv("popularsongs.csv")
dtf

```

### Challenges of cleaning of Data:

One of the challenges that I faced while cleaning the data on Excel was the amount of iterations needed.
As there were symbols that made it difficult to read, I removed them by using the Find & Replace function on excel.
I did this so that it would be easier to call out certain names and make them more readable to the user.**I only did this for the variable "artist" as I will be using this variable to make comparisons**

### Old

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", out.height="20%",fig.cap="Strings of text with symbols",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("~/Documents/GitHub/NM2207/Week-10/beforeclean2.png"))
```

### New

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", out.height="20%",fig.cap="After removing the symbol",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("~/Documents/GitHub/NM2207/Week-10/afterclean.png"))

Week 11 Diary:

</h1>

### (1) List the visualizations that you are going to use in your project

**Bar Graph: Bivariate Relationship Between Danceability and Energy**

(a)I will be using the *Danceability* and *Energy* variables which are of double data type.

(b)This could help to visualize the relationship between how danceable a track is and its energy level.My hypothesis is that there is no bivariate relationship between danceability and energy as there are songs which maybe low in energy but have high danceability in them.(E.g Slow songs that are meant for slow dancing)

**Heatmap: Heatmap of correlations**

(a)The variables I will be using are danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, and tempo.

(b)This will allow me to identify the relationships between the variables and how musicians can use this information to understand their target audience better.

### (2) How do you plan to make it interactive?

**Bar Graph: Bivariate Relationship Between Danceability and Energy**

-   Dropdown Menu for Coloring: Allows users to choose whether the points should be colored based on genre or album type.
-   Slider for Danceability Range: Lets users filter the data based on a range of danceability values.
-   Slider for Energy Range: Lets users filter the data based on a range of energy values.

**Heatmap: Heatmap of correlations**

-   Checkboxes: To select which features to include in the correlation matrix.
-   Dropdown: To choose the method of correlation
-   Reset Button: to recompute the heatmap after changing the selections.

## Error with setting background image

This is a minimal task! But I am still unable to set the correct image and allow it to be displayed on my screen. I will try to get this done before the final submission.


## Error with setting video wrap

One Issue that I had was the setting of the video alignment on the About page.
I was unable to get a straight video that covers the full section of the screen even after referencing Quarto.org for the guides.

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="50%", out.height="20%",fig.cap=" The standardised width was not appropriate for my screen",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("~/Documents/GitHub/NM2207/Week-12/error4.png"))
```

In the end, I had to tweak around the values for width and stuck with -605vw. I think that there should be some errors in my settings as I understand that it should automatically fit the picture to my screen.

## Valence Bargraph

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="50%", out.height="20%",fig.cap=" The standardised width was not appropriate for my screen",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("~/Documents/GitHub/NM2207/Week-12/error2.png"))
```

I had this error when trying to process the column "Stream" as I did not clean my dataset well enough to realise that there was invalid characters in the dataset. This has prevented me from being able to display my bar graph.

As a result, I had referenced some help from Chatgpt & source from this [StackOverflow post] and realised that I had to add the following code:

```mutate_if(is.character, utf8::utf8_encode)```

## Word Cloud

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="50%", out.height="20%",fig.cap=" Word Cloud Adjustment",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("~/Documents/GitHub/NM2207/Week-12/error9.png"))
```

For this particular error, I had faced this issue of being unable to run my word cloud.
One of the reasons was because while searching up on line on how to do a word cloud, I realised that my dataset was too large and the Column "Tracks" had too many rows for the word cloud to show.
Hence, rather than setting the min frequency to 1, I set it to 2 instead as seen below.

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="50%", out.height="20%",fig.cap=" Word Cloud Adjustment",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("~/Documents/GitHub/NM2207/Week-12/error10.png"))
```

**(1) min.freq : I had increased the limit from 1 to 2 as it showed too little words and I wanted to make it more meaningful by showing more varieties of words.**

**(2) max.word: I had set a limit to 100 as the function was unable to process and fit all the words in my graph.**

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="100%",fig.cap="Updated Code",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("~/Documents/GitHub/NM2207/Week-12/error12.png"))
```

I plan to enhance this word cloud using this example provided by [Rul,2019](https://towardsdatascience.com/create-a-word-cloud-with-r-bde3e7422e8a).This would be really useful as I can make different shapes and sizes of Word Cloud without being limited to HTML's style of word cloud.
One issue with the current code that I have is that it is limited to the design I can make for it and I would like to try to be more experimental.

## Line graph

I had the error of the wrong data type used in the function sum. I did not realised that streams were all in character type and it should have been in numeric data type in order for me to manipulate them in sum.

As such, I used the as.numeric() function to request R to read them as numeric values instead which worked.

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="100%",fig.cap="Updated Code",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("~/Documents/GitHub/NM2207/Week-12/error13.png"))
```

## Pie Chart (In Progress)

I am still in the midst of coming up with the code.

### Importance of the Theme

The theme of the story is "Relationship between Musical Attributes". The theme is to understand the relationships between musical attributes and to find out how musicians and writers/producers to better understand how their music affects the audience's reaction to their music. It is particularly pertinent to because it affects how companies can work with different scales of music and see which types of notes are commonly used in today's music. It can also impact how production house intends to market its music and how their artists can use their music to influence the overall music trend globally

### Data Sources and Justification

For my data sources, I have downloaded them from Kaggle, which is an open source website that contains datasets curated by other users. I have chosen 2 datasets from there, both which contained data about the musical attributes and their relative songs. They also include names of the tracks and artists, and the streams these songs have.

This dataset is relevant as I am looking to identify the relationships between the musical attributes, and tell me how audiences view artists with different types and levels of musical attributes. This can also tell me the musical attitudes that audiences have and how whether they prefer music with different underlying tones.

The credibility of Kaggle can be attributed to its millions of active users daily and also by reviewing the upvotes given to a particular dataset by other users or by reviewing the notebooks shared using the dataset (DataCamp, 2022). For mine, I reviewed the datasets and read through comments of people who had previously used the same materials. Although there were comments stating that the dataset was unclean, I was able to review the dataset and cleaned it up in R and Excel.

### Interpretation of Data:

#### Bar Graph: 

One of the findings from the data story that caught my attention is the relationship between Valence and Danceability. They are highly positively correlated, which explains why most sounds with high positiveness results in high danceability in the attitude audiences and listeners have towards songs, and also determines the ease with which a person could dance to a song over the course of the whole song. Additionally, most songs which have the key C, E and G Major commonly do well and are widely used. Major Keys also tend to denote that the songs are in a "happier" pitch.

This suggests that songs that are mostly euphoric sounding tend to have high danceability to them. In this age of virality music, having songs that allow listeners to dance to them and post them on social media often results in higher virality due to the widespread use of the music to show off dance moves, which is popular among the younger generation.

However, I also found that not all songs with low valence means that these songs are less popular. My findings showed that even singers such as Billie Ellish, with a low valence of 0.2 has more than the average number of streams by any artists. This corresponds to a finding that suggests while viral songs are often moderately high in danceability and energy, some of the viral hits show that songs don't necessarily need to be high energy or choreography-ready to achieve success on social media platforms (Eggleston, 2022)

#### Valence Bar Graph:

The graph is useful to understand the comparison between the average valence score for all artists in this list and the selected artist. As we can see from the summary table, the median valence score is about 0.537, which means that more than 50% of the songs in the list have an average of score higher or equal to 0.537. This means that most songs are happier and "positive".

### Implementation of the Project

I started the project by developing my Shiny Apps first as those took the longest amount of time to think of and develop. As they were more dynamic in nature, I also sought to find the different use cases for the graph and researched through different websites to figure the best use of different plots. Additionally, I used a myriad of learning tools such as Stack Overflow, W3 Schools and Chatgpt to assist me in areas of the graph which I do not understand. I also sought help from my TAs and friends to help me debug my graphs. Subsequently, I started working on the static graphs using ggplot/ggplot2 as I was more familiar with it. I started on writing the descriptions of the graphs after I was done with the analysis so that I could better link the concepts together.

Some of the newer concepts which I picked up was Bootstrap 5 and HTML to create some features that were not available in R. This allowed me to design the website in a more aesthetic manner apart from using the default theme of R. Additionally, I also used different packages such as kableExtra, wordcloud2 and Rbrewcolour to create some of the graphs that I created. This packages allowed me to extend my idea in a more formative manner and allowed me to show case the data in a concise and creative manner.
